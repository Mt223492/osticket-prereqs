I installed PHP Manager for IIS (PHPManagerForIIS_V1.5.0.msi) to enhance the management of PHP applications on Windows servers. This tool is vital for configuring and maintaining PHP settings within Internet Information Services (IIS). By using PHP Manager, I streamlined the process of registering PHP with IIS, managing multiple PHP installations, and optimizing PHP settings for improved performance and security. This installation was essential for ensuring that PHP applications, such as OS Ticket, run smoothly and efficiently on the server, making it a crucial step in setting up a robust and high-performing web environment.

I installed the MySQL 5.5.62 package for Windows (mysql-5.5.62-win32.msi) to implement the MySQL database system on Windows servers, which is a core component for the functionality of OS Ticket. This installation ensured a stable and efficient database environment for OS Ticket, an open-source support ticket system widely used for managing customer support queries. With MySQL 5.5.62, I was able to provide the necessary database infrastructure to store and retrieve ticket information, ensuring smooth operation and quick response times. This installation was crucial for leveraging OS Ticket’s full potential, making it a critical step in setting up a reliable and high-performance support ticket system.
